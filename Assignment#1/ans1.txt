CS 35L Laboratory Assignment 1

1. The man keyword allows you to read the manual page for a linux command. Therefore, for example, man man allows you to print all the commands that have a specific word in the man page.
   1. man -k [command]
   2. man man


2. where mv and sh programs are located in the file system
   -which sh or whereis sh
      1. sh: /usr/bin/sh 
   -which mv or whereis mv
      1. mv: /usr/bin/mv or  /usr/local/cs/bin/mv


3. executable programs
   1. man -k ^.r$ or man -k ^[a-z]r$
ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
pr - convert text files for printing
tr - translate or delete characters


4. The actual file is /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 because /usr/bin/emacs has a soft link to /etc/alternatives/emacs. Shell commands I used:
cd /usr/bin
ls -l emacs* 
	//see that emacs is pointing to /etc/alternatives/emacs
cd /etc/alternatives
ls -l emacs* 
	//see that it’s /usr/bin/emacs-24.3


5. 
/usr/bin/gcc -v
	From the above command, the gcc version was 4.8.5
gcc -v
	The plain gcc version is 9.2.0
which gcc
	The command shows the plain gcc is located in /usr/local/cs/bin
The difference is that there are multiple versions of gcc installed on various file systems. For example, one is located /usr/bin and another is located /usr/local/cs/bin


6. use command 'man chmod' to find what the symbolic modes mean.
u+sx means set user permission to execute only and user ID upon execution. The breakdown of the symbolic mode is:
      1. u means the permissions granted to the user who owns the file
      2. s means set user or group on execution
      3. x means execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has executed permission for some user (X)
      4. + operator causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file
 
o-w removes write permissions from all other users. The breakdown is:
      1. o means the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the user or file’s group
      2. w means write
      3. - causes the selected file mode bits to be removed
    
  
7. general command: find DIR_PATH -type d -mtime -N_DAYS
   1. find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
Output (first 5):
/usr/local/cs
/usr/local/cs/src/bison
/usr/local/cs/src/bison/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/gnuplot
/usr/local/cs/src/gnuplot/RCS
Total: 175 using the shell command find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc


8. find /usr/bin -type l | wc
There are 280 symbolic links.


9. ls -lt pathName so I used the command ls -lt /usr/lib64
   1. The oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory is librom1394.so.0.3.0 with last-modified time being December 28, 2013.


10. man locale /pathName
The  locale command displays information about the current locale, or all locales, on standard output.


11. C-h a downcase has 3: downcase-dwim, downcase-region, downcase-word
      1. downcase-dwim M-x ... RET -Downcase words in the region, if active; if not, downcase word at point.
      2. downcase-region C-x C-l -Convert the region to lower case.  In programs, wants two arguments.
      3. downcase-word M-l --Convert to lowercase from point to end of word, moving over.


12.    
   1. C-h c C-M-r runs the command Regexp I-search backward.
   2. C-h c C-M-s runs the command isearch-forward-regexp
   3. C-h c C-M-t runs the command transpose-sexps
   4. C-h c C-M-u runs the command backward-up-list
   5. C-h c C-M-v runs the command scroll-other-window


13. C-h c C-g runs the command keyboard-quit. Another one is C-s C-g


14. C-h f yank or C-h k C-y
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text. More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.


15.    
   1. emacs C-x d /usr/bin for the directory listing of the emacs file
   2. ls -l
      1. ls -l /usr/bin had 2856 outputs
   3. The difference is C-x d (dired command) displays all files, including hidden and regular files. C-x d command also allows you to perform operations on those files. On the other hand, ls -l just lists all the files.

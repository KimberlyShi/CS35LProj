tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This command found each character that wasn't a-zA-Z & 
replaced with a new line.
The only characters outputed will be  a-zA-Z with new lines in between.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This command will also find every non a-zA-Z.
Replace with a single new line. 
However, because of the -s, there will not be repeated new lines.
 Every a-z A-Z will only have one new line in between with no excess new lines.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort
This command will sort all the words 
(including repeated words and characters) in alphabetical order.
It will then separate 'word' being a new line. 
The lower case letters will come before the upper case letters.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u
This command is similar to the above command,
 which sorts all the words. 
However, with the additional -u command, all the duplicates will be removed.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm - words
There are 3 columns:
	1. Will display all the output from the previous column.
	2. Will display all the words from file 'words'
	3. Will find the words in common between the 2 files

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words 
# ENGLISHCHECKER
This command will check for any spelling errors. 
Only the lines that are in both column 2&3 
will be displayed so essentially all the unique words in 
assign2.html will be displayed. 
These will be the misspelled words that were not found in the file'words.'

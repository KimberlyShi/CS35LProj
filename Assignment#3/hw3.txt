Q1: The patch improves the performance of ls becuase it is now 
able to properly displace -a and -A. So when the user writes 
the -A, the . and .. will not be overriden by -a and 
will no longer display . and ..


Q2: When adopting this patch, you need to watch out that the patch
 will not undermine and previous behaviors or functions of the program
 before the patch was isntalled.


Q3. When I ran the command
	python randline.py /dev/null
The program would traceback to the most recent call:
 File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.16/lib/python2.7\
	/random.py", line 277, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
	  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This index error occurs because the program is expecting input 
on line 34 when trying to access an empty line will throw an error.


Q4. When try to run the randline.py using python3 gives the following error:
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because in Python2, the syntax would be 
	except IOError as (errno, strerror):
and in Python3, the syntax should be except IOError as err:


Q5: When I ran my program using python2 instead of python3,
 the program functioned as expected. This is becuase the syntax
that I had implemented in my program is compatible in both python2 
and python3. 
However, an exception was when the program was reading user input 
using stdin. This is because the input function from python2 
and python3 have different behaviors.

Assignment 8 Lab Log
1-4. After connecting the BeagleBone and opening START.htm file, I installed
the drivers.

5. To ssh into my BeagleBone:
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
I then inputted my computer's password, then BeagleBone's password when prompted

6. Connect the BeagleBone with wifi
connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
This was the output: Scan completed for wifi

conmanctly > services
The following were all the access points:
*AR CR3760-wifi          wifi_2cf7f1066e58_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk

conmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1066e58_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
conmanctly> quit

7. Already connected to CR3760-wifi.
 
8. Find IP address of the BeagleBone using the following command:
ifconfig

This was the following output:
Under "wlan0" this was the output:
wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 2c:f7:f1:06:6e:58  
          inet addr:10.97.85.247  Bcast:10.97.85.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::2ef7:f1ff:fe06:6e58/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST DYNAMIC  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:4428 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:864 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:1034468 (1010.2 KiB)  TX bytes:114545 (111.8 KiB)

Therefore, the IP address is listed under "inet addr"
IP Address: 10.97.85.247


9. Now that I have an Internet connectoin, update database of apt-get:
I ran the following command:
sudo apt-get update

For forwarding support for future SSH connections to my BeagleBone,
I installed xauth and xvfb for X11 with the following commands:
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb


10. To check that X11 is enabled for X11 forwarding:
On both cliet and server, will need to run the following command:
cd /etc/ssh/ssh_config
cd /etc/ssh/sshd_config

The files did not exist.

11. Install Firefox on my BeagleBone with the following command:
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb 

My partner is Eugene Lo (UID: 905108982)
His IP address is 10.97.85.233
My IP address is 10.97.85.247


=============Server Steps======================
To set up the server:
To install openssh-server and openssh-client on BeagleBone:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

To generate public and private keys:
ssh-keygen

This was the following output:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
9f:93:87:d3:71:0a:80:d9:6a:3a:0e:98:5b:47:2b:27 root@localhost
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|       +         |
|      o o        |
|       . .       |
|    . o S . . .  |
| o . +   . * +   |
|o E *     B +    |
| o B .     +     |
|.   .            |
+-----------------+

Then my partner is the client on the server so I created a separate account:
sudo useradd -d /home/eug -m eug
sudo passwd eug

I saved the password as 'password'

I then set up the ssh directory for my partner and also changed all 
the permssions to read, write, and execute:

cd /home/eug
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R eug .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Eugene did the same steps on his server except that the directory
name is kim

==========Clinet Steps==========
To log into my partner's:

I did the following command with my partner's IP address.
ssh kim@10.97.85.233

Then I logged in with the password that my partner created which was password

$ ssh-keygen
This was the following output:

Your identification has been saved in /home/kim/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/kim/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
45:6f:31:67:f3:5d:47:7f:31:05:7b:e7:e3:f9:ac:70 kim@804962948.lasr.cs.ucla.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|          . o ==*|
|         . . = +B|
|          . o . B|
|         . .   oo|
|        S      ..|
|              . o|
|            . Eo |
|             o ..|
|              ..o|
+-----------------+



I set the passphrase as password

To copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication:
ssh-copy-id -i kim@10.97.85.233

During this command, I had to enter in the oassword and it now has added 1 key.
ssh kim@10.97.85.233

I was prompted to enter in my passphrase in order to access my private key.
To add private key to authentication agent (ssh-agent):
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

This was the following output:
Agent pid 18904

ssh-add

Then, since it is now recognized, it will not ask for the passphrase
again.

ssh into the root with the reset:
sudo ssh -X root@192.168.7.2
ssh -X kim@10.97.85.233

I than ran a command on the remote host:
xterm
xeyes

My XQaurtz was able to launch successfully and I see a graphical representation
of eyes.

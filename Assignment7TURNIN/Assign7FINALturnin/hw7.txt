Homework 7
1. To create file:
emacs hw7.txt

2. Checkout ver 3.0 of Diffutils into new branch "quote"
cd diffutils
git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

This was the following output:

3. Install change into new branch
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)
This emacs command adds a new entry to the change lof file for the file
you are editing.

5. Compose ChangeLog entry for patch
emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
C-x 4 a

This was my text:
2019-11-14  Kimberly Lin Shi  <kimberls@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt: In these	following files:
        src/cmp.c
        src/diff.c
        src/diff3.c
	src/dir.c
        src/sdiff.c
        src/util.c
        A patch	was applied to those files to change ` into ' in string	constants.

C-x C-c to save the ChangeLog


6. Commit changes to new branch
ChangeLog entry is the commit message

mv quote-3.0-patch.txt ..
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

7. Patch working without additional fixes
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Verification
My partner is Alyssa Wang.
UID: 205110851

I saved my partner's patch as formatted-patch-alyssa.txt
To verify my partner's work, I first checked out into a new branch.
git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'
git am < formatted-patch-alyssa.txt
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

Just like in the lab, the make check command ran into errors. However,
upon further investigation, I noticed that the patch had worked as intended.

Then, just like the lab, I tested the following commands:
src/diff . -
This was the following output:
src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory


src/diff --help
Just like my patch in the lab, the patch was successful in replacing all
` with '

9. Verify ChangeLog entry works
make distdir
I see that a new directory was created called diffutils-3.0.1-67ba

When I open the directory that was created, I can see that the ChangeLog is
my partner's with the first couple of lines being her ChangeLog:

2019-11-16  Alyssa Mei Yi Wang  <alyssaw@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

        quote \'like this\' or "like this", not `like this\'


10. Find the newest merge not newer than 2015-01-25

I opened a new terminal window and logged in with
ssh -X kimberls@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

The last merge not newer then 2015-01-25 is actually 2015-01-25
This was the following merge:

Merge branch 'master' into xwidget 2015-01-25 12:19:27

Description of the subwindows:
At the top window is the commit message in 1 column. Then the user email is 
in the second column and lastly, the commit date and time is in the last column.

Underneath the top window is the the diff on the left (can also select to view
the 'old version' and the 'new version'.)

On the right of that is either the option of 'patch' or 'tree'
